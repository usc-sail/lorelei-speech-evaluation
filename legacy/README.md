This is the evaluation script version used for the first pilot in 2016.
It uses a significantly different algorith for selecting confidence thresholds to calculate P-R for.
It may produce significantly different results for very low recall, because performance is very noisy at low recall.

Should not be used.
Only included for posterity.
